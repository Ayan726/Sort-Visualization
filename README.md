# Sort-Visualization
This is a web-based sorting visualizer that allows users to visualize how different sorting algorithms work. It includes four major sorting algorithms: Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Insertion Sort, and Bubble Sort. The visualizer is built using HTML, Tailwind CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. Async and await functions are used to animate the sorting process, and a slider allows users to change the number of bars or array length.

# Features
- Four major sorting algorithms: Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Insertion Sort, and Bubble Sort.
- A slider that allows users to change the number of bars or array length.
- A shuffle button that randomizes the array.
- Color-coded bars that animate and visualize the sorting process.
- The size of each bar is written inside it.
- While a sorting visualization is going on, the user cannot press any sort buttons or use the slider.

# Usage
To use the sorting visualizer, follow these steps:

- Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/Ayan726/Sort-Visualization.git
- Open the index.html file in your browser.
- Use the slider to change the number of bars or array length.
- Click the shuffle button to randomize the array.
- Select a sorting algorithm from the menu to visualize the sorting process.    
    
**Note**: While a sorting visualization is going on, the user cannot press any sort buttons or use the slider. Right after the the array is sorted, the user needs to randomize the array, otherwise he/she won't be able to use any functionalities.
